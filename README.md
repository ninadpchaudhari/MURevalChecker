MURevalChecker
==============

Checks Mumbai University revaluation Results (Technology Only for now) periodically , notifies as the site is updated and also (planned for giving notification for roll nos.)

Run checkifchanged.sh and it will check if the MU site is updated !
also, it will call the main.sh script if needed to download all the PDFs in the allpdfs folder


TODO:
Add Email notification for changed Mu Reval Page
Add PDF to Text to all the PDFs in the folder and then setup email Notifications

Research :
Current Hypothesis:
Make a web app to get users mail addresses and create a new Mailing list ... 
I think I may may just make a rss feed and then let ppl subscribe via feedburner ...
The rss page can be updated via the command line
